    <h4 style="text-align: center;">10 Things You didn't know about Albert Einstein</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> He never failed math. This is a popular "fact" promoted on the internet,
             maybe in an attempt to relate to genius. However, it is simply not true.
             Overall, Einstein was an average student, but math was one area where
             he excelled, unsurprisingly.</li>
        <li> Einstein encouraged the development of the nuclear bomb. His involvement
             is often misinterpreted, with some claiming that he helped create the atom bomb.
             In reality, what he did was write a letter to President FDR encouraging him to begin
             work on such a weapon, which led to the Manhattan Project. Although a dedicated
             pacifist and, later, an anti-nuke spokesman, Einstein was convinced that America 
             needed the atomic bomb before the Nazis. </li>
        <li> He was a great musician. If the whole "genius" thing didn't work out, Einstein could
             have become a violinist. His mother played piano so he had the love of music instilled
             in him—via violin lessons—at the young age of five.</li>
        <li> He could have been the President of Israel. When Israel's first president, Chaim VVeizmann,
             died, Einstein was offered the position, but he declined.</li>
        <li> He married his cousin. After Einstein divorced his first wife, Mileva Mat he married his cousin,
             Elsa Lowenthal. He was, actually, quite a bad husband to his first wife in their later years. 
             He had affairs he never tried to hide, he moved the entire family to Berlin without discussion,
             and treated her more as a servant than a wife.</li>
        <li> He won the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics. This alone isn't particularly surprising. What is
             surprising is the fact that he didn't receive it for the general or special theory of
             relativity, but rather for the photoelectric effect.</li>
        <li> He loved to sail. Ever since university, Einstein sailed as a hobby. But by his own admission,
             he never made a particularly good sailer. In fact, he didn't even know how to swim.</li>
        <li> He really didn't like socks, and usually didn't wear them. In fact, in a letter to Elsa,
             he bragged about getting away "without wearing socks" while at Oxford.</li>
        <li> He had an illegitimate daughter. This wasn't known until the 1980s, but according to 
             correspondence between Albert and Mileva it was determined that the two had a daughter in
             1902 called Lieserl. At one point, all mention of her in letters stopped so her fate is unknown.</li>
        <li> His brain was stolen. After Einstein died, the pathologist who did his autopsy took his brain
             without permission. He eventually got the permission necessary from Einstein's son, but he was
             fired from Princeton when he refused to turn the brain over. He kept it for over forty years
             before finally returning it in 1998.</li>
    </ul>
